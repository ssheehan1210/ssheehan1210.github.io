## Project 1: The Game

## Jeopardy

1. As a User, I want to be able to access the game board so I can play the game with a second player.
2. As an Admin, I want to be able to update each question in each category so that each question can be seen/answered by the players when they are pulled up.
3. As a User, I want to be able to pull up a modal for each question I select and be able to answer each question.
4. As a User, I want to be able to gain points when I answer the question correctly and see the answer screen.
5. As an Admin, I want to be able to switch the turn over to the other player whenever the original player either misses the question or runs out of time.
6. As an Admin, I want the boxes to each answered question to be deactivated so that they won't be selected again.
7. As a User in the role of Player 1, I want it to be my turn at the beginning and whenever my opponent finishes his turn regardless of whether Player 2 got it right or wrong, as well as whenever time runs out for Player 2.
8. As an Admin, I want a victory window to appear when all the questions have been answered and reveal who the winner is.
