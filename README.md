## Project 1: Jeopardy

### Directions:
In this game, you (Player 1) and one local opponent (Player 2) will compete for the highest points with gameplay that closely reflects the popular television game show: Jeopardy.

Select whatever button on the game board across any of the five categories and you will be given 15 seconds to answer a given question. If you type in the correct answer and press the submit button before time runs out, you will get the points assigned to the question. If you submit the wrong answer or run out of time, you will not get any points and will have to wait until your next turn before you can try again.

Whether you get the correct answer or not, once you are back to the main game board, it will be your opponent's turn. Player 2 will go through the same steps and once his turn is finished, it will be your turn once again.

The game will end when all of the questions have been asked/answered and the player with the most points wins the game!

### Technology Used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- AJAX

### User Stories:
1. As a User, I want to be able to access the game board so I can play the game with a second player.
2. As an Admin, I want to be able to update each question in each category so that each question can be seen/answered by the players when they are pulled up.
3. As a User, I want to be able to pull up a modal for each question I select and be able to answer each question.
4. As a User, I want to be able to gain points when I answer the question correctly and see the answer screen.
5. As an Admin, I want to be able to switch the turn over to the other player whenever the original player either misses the question or runs out of time.
6. As an Admin, I want the boxes to each answered question to be deactivated so that they won't be selected again.
7. As a User in the role of Player 1, I want it to be my turn at the beginning and whenever my opponent finishes his turn regardless of whether Player 2 got it right or wrong, as well as whenever time runs out for Player 2.
8. As an Admin, I want a victory window to appear when all the questions have been answered and reveal who the winner is.

### What I Want To Add In The Future:
- Catchy background music.
- A quick popup that will allow the ability to input the players' names.
- Animations and more visually appealing modals.
- A question randomizer so that each instance of the game will have a different set of questions based on their respective category.
- Make my CSS stylesheet and HTML code much more DRY.
